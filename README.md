# Salling-DK-Recipe-generator
AI-powered recipe generator using discounted Salling products and fridge items for smarter, sustainable cooking. This application demonstrates how modern AI can be seamlessly integrated into a basic Tkinter interface, delivering accurate and practical results. It highlights the potential for everyday tools to drive meaningful, real-world impact—such as reducing food waste, saving money, and promoting sustainability.

## Location-Based Discount Discovery
A user living in Copenhagen has the ability to set their location and desired walk/travel distance. The application connects to Salling Group's "Anti Food Waste API" to retrieve all discounted products available within that zone.
